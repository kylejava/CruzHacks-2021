## How Noteify Started

Noteify started in Jan. 2021 during a hackathon called CruzHacks. I wanted to find solutions that improve one's mental health.

## What is next with Noteify?

Our team is planning to fix up all the spaghetti code as well as redesign the platform. We believe that this platform will help people think in a more positive way leading to a better lifestyle.

Below are some excerpts from the Devpost submission, here you will learn more about Noteify.

## Inspiration

For my project, I wanted to tackle a problem that not only affected me, but to a lot of people in the world. I started thinking about how I used to suffer from imposter syndrome, and my way of overcoming this mentality would be reminding myself of all the amazing things I have worked so hard for and thinking in a more positive manner. This led me to thinking in a more broader scope outside of people who faced with imposter syndrome. I did a lot of research on how thinking more positively affects a person's mental health. With the increase of depression and other various mental illnesses increasing, it is important to take this matter seriously. There is a lot of research on how positive mindset and way of thinking can improve one's mental and physical health, leading to a more healthier and better lifestyle. While it may seem easy to tell people who suffer from mental illnesses to have a more positive mindset, many people struggle with this. One way to start thinking more positively is to remind yourself of your own accomplishments, the people around you who support you, the dreams you want to achieve, and etc. What better way to remind yourself than by using notes!

## What it does

Noteify is a website that users can use to start getting into a more positive mindset and improve their own mental health. Users can register for an account on Noteify and be able to use the platform. The user will be greeted with a notepad where they can create new notes, as well as five jars, each representing for various events and feelings. Once the user chooses to create a note they will click on the notepad which will take them to an empty note where they can write a note for themselves. This note can either be a funny old story, an accomplishment they are proud of, anything they want to write. Once the user creates the note, they have the option to put it in one of the jars. If a user wants to open one of the jars they can click on one of them and be greeted with a random note that the user has submitted from that specific jar, refreshing the page brings up another note the user has submitted in the past.
